how to delete sensitive files or replace credentials in sensitive files
with "***REMOVED***"

## Prerequisites

* BFG Repo-Cleaner - `brew install bfg`

---

**Understand the following before starting**

> By default the BFG doesn't modify the contents of your latest commit on your master
  (or 'HEAD') branch, even though it will clean all the commits before it.

> That's because your latest commit is likely to be the one that you deploy to production, and a simple deletion of a private credential or a big file is quite likely to result in broken code that no longer has the hard-coded data it expects - you need to fix that, the BFG can't do it for you. Once you've committed your changes- and your latest commit is clean with none of the undesired data in it - you can run the BFG to perform it's simple deletion operations over all your historical commits.
